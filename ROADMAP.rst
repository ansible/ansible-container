Roadmap for Ansible Container
=============================

Each major and minor release will receive a roadmap, and it will appear here. When a new roadmap is published
an announcement will be made on the `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_.

A roadmap is the team's *best guess* based on experience, and community requests and feedback. There are things that may
not be included due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc. There also may be things that simply get missed,
so roadmaps are published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible Container, and as a means for seeking further
feedback from the community.

Ways to submit feedback:

  - `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_
  - #ansible-container on irc.freenode.net
  - `Open an issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/new>`_
  - Join us at the next `AnsibleFest or RedHat Summit <https://www.ansible.com/blog/topic/ansiblefest>`_
